This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

As a dummy project it will be used to exercise integrating next.js over a meetups spa and will use firebase realtime database capabilities to work with dinamic data!
