This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

As a dummy project it will be used to exercise integrating next.js over a meetups spa and will use firebase realtime database capabilities to work with dinamic data! It may metamorphose into a real app!

Started Database integration for newsletter and comments!

This document got eddited! How is the eddit going to affect the push and how is the merge going to be affected?
